# datastruct

Collection of Java classes with coding problems which come during whiteboard interview. All of them have my own solutoin

Most of them are from [leetcode.com](https://www.leetcode.com)

easy.ReverseString - reverse String recursively
<br><br><br>
easy.TwoNumbers - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target
<br><br><br> 
easy.SumOfNumbers - Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
<br>Return the running sum of nums.
<br><br><br> 
easy.JewelsAndStones - You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.<br>
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels
<br>Return the running the number of jewels
<br><br><br> 
easy.NumOfGoodPairs - Given an array of integers nums. A pair (i,j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.
<br>Return the number of good pairs.
<br><br><br> 

There is a lot more inside the project. Just look inside. Each class is accompanied with the detailed problem description and examples to help to solve it.
